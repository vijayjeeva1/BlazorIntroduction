@* Since this does not have page directive, this is a non-routable component. 
It can be used inside other components but can't be located with url. 
This will be used inside the Servers.razor routable component. *@

<div data-name="@server.Name" 
	data-status="Server is @(server.IsOnline ? "online" : "offline")"
	 style="@($"color:{(server.IsOnline ? "green" : "red")}")">
	@server.Name is in @server.City that is @(server.IsOnline ? "online" : "offline")
</div>

@code {
	private Server server = new Server { Name = "Server 1", City = "Toronto" };
